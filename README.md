# sara

SARA is where i tried to create my own Jarvis. Right now its just limited to one or 2 functionalities but i plan to add more features over time

Right now if you say 'play call me maybe' it searches a given directory and plays the first result. One of the improvements that can be made here is instead of returning the 1st found result, return the most relevant result. Here we can give a score to each of the files using tf-idf 

### I still havent thought of a full form for SARA. Tell me if you have any suggestions. 
(One thing i thought was Special Artificaial _______ Agent)
